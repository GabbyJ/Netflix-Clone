# Notflix
To take a break from tutorials, I decided to try creating a Netflix clone called Notflix to practice the Bootsrap I learned. Day 1 consisted of getting the content added and creating some basic styling. Day 2 consisted of more styling and I'm pretty satisfied with the product. I will fix the mobile styling next because I thought it looked fine, but it didn't once published and I was able to check on my phone.

I'd like to be able to create the Netflix library one day as I get more advanced.
