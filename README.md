# Netflix-Clone
To take a break from tutorials, I decided to try creating a Netflix clone to practice the Bootsrap I learned. Day 1 consisted of getting the content added and creating some basic styling. Next I'll add more detailed styling.

I'd like to be able to create the Netflix library one day as I get more advanced.

Created Using:
<ul>
  <li>Bootstrap 4</li>
  <li>HTML5</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
</ul>
